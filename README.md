# BTS-D2D-Project-MatLab: Energy consumption-based comparison between routing protocols in MWSN
Author: Rubén Diab

Goal project:  Energy consumption-based comparison between routing protocols in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSN)

Implemented routing protocols:
· Direct communication
· LEACH
· PEGASIS
· DREAM

Channel and Energy consumption functions implemented:
· RF channel model for D2D according to Shannon-Hartley theorem
· Lauridsen power consumption model for D2D

In order to obtain the desired results is needed to execute this codes:
- In the case without mobility: all_main_no_mobility.m
- In the case with mobility: all_main.m
